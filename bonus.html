        <p>The Tillamook Rock lighthouse was constructed in 1881 over the course of 575 days. The project was grueling, isolating and dangerous on the isolated rock surrounded by the pacific. the construction caused at least on fatality, a mason was swept out to sea while surveying, they never found his body.</p>
       <p>this was only the start of the many lives the volatile sea would claim while the light house was operational, leading many to speculate on the ghosts of those dead sailors haunting the remains</p>
       <h2> whispering in the stairs</h2>
       <p>The shifts of the lighthouse workers where already shortened due the intense physical and mental conditions of the rock, but even then they where sometimes shortened even further as lighthouse keepers left in distress. apparently amoung the crashing of the waves other noises could be heard in the depths of the lighthouse, including the cries of drowning men calling out for help from the staircase. the stress of hearing that all night was apparently too much for some of them to handle. it could just be a hoax, but you never know...</p>

            <h2>Final log entry of the last lighthouse keeper</h2>
            <p style=" font-family: monospace;">“Farewell, Tillamook Rock Light Station. An era has ended. With this final entry,
             and not without sentiment, I return thee to the elements. You, one of the most notorious and yet fascinating of the sea-swept 
             sentinels in the world; long the friend of the tempest-tossed mariner. Through howling gale, thick fog and driving rain your 
             beacon has been a star of hope and your foghorn a voice of encouragement. May the elements of nature be kind to you. For 77 years you 
             have beamed your light across desolate acres of ocean. Keepers have come and gone; men lived and died; but you were faithful to the end. 
             May your sunset years be good years. Your purpose is now only a symbol, but the lives you have saved and the service you have rendered are
              worthy of the highest respect. A protector of life and property to all, may old-timers, newcomers and travelers along the way pause from the shore
               in memory of your humanitarian role.”</p>
            <p style="margin:0px;"id="italicserif">- September 1, 1957, Keeper Oswald Allik</p>
